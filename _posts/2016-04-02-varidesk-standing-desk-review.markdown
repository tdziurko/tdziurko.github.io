I was thinking about buying a standing desk for quite some time, but always when I was almost convinced to buy one, 
I had one unsolved problem: what to do with my old, wooden desk. It is a solid furniture with four drawers 
where I store many indispensable things and I didn’t want to toss it away. But about six months ago my friend 
showed me a new furniture in his home office – a VariDesk standing desk. I needed only a few looks to know that 
I want it too :) 

[Varidesk](http://www.varidesk.com/) is a producer of adjustable standing desks that can be placed on any table or
desk so you don’t loose your old furniture, you only augment it with standing-desk functionality. Because at work
I am using two external 27'' monitors I have ordered the largest model named Pro Plus 48. And the first thing I have 
noticed after package have arrived to my home is that this thing is huge and really heavy.

I had to help the courier to carry it to the third floor and after unboxing it I really struggled to put it on my desk. 
But after a few tries I have finally done it and I could start arranging cables to use my new setup.

This is how it looks in sitting mode:

As you can see it is a really large desk, but thanks to this two large monitors fit there easily. Mine are 27’’ 
but there is still some free room so even two 30+ should be fine. Another good thing is that there is still plenty 
of space left for your mug of coffee, a notebook or any random stuff you often have on your desk. Varidesk has 
a special spring-assisted lifting mechanism so even with two monitors on board it can be easily lifted up to 
standing mode. And changing positions is a matter of only a few seconds.

Materials used to build Varidesk are solid and easy to clean, nothing is creaking, nothing is swinging loose. 
There are also versions in white colour but black looked more attractive to me.

## Summary
Whole setup is very stable (Varidesk is so heavy for a reason), its height is adjustable (11 different positions) 
and, what is very important for me, I can still use my old desk and its drawers to store stuff. Additionally, 
it looks really, really impressive in a standing mode. One friend when she saw it for the first time compared 
it to some kind of center of operations :)

So if you are thinking about a standing desk I can recommend Varidesk as a good choice. They offer various models 
with different sizes and setups so everyone should be able to find something suited to their needs.
