## Hello, I'm Tomek

Currently, I work as Vice President of Engineering at [SoftwareMill](https://softwwaremill.com). Before that 
for over 15 years I was a Software Engineer (Junior/Regular/Senior) and a Team Leader. After two years spent in management, I have 
decided to widen my horizons and go back to school again. After extremely intensive two years, in 2024 I graduated 
at MBA studies at [Kozminski University](https://www.kozminski.edu.pl/en), the #1 business school in Central and Eastern Europe.
